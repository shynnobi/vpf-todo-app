- Always use `--json` flag with GitHub CLI commands to produce structured output
- Pipe output through `jq` to filter and format results (e.g., `gh pr list --json x,y,z | jq '.[]'`)
- Avoid interactive commands that require manual input or paging
- For PR operations, prefer specific flags like `--title`, `--body` over interactive prompts
- When showing PR details, use targeted queries instead of full views (e.g., commits only, files only)
- Format complex outputs as single-line JSON objects to prevent terminal overflow
- Test GitHub CLI commands with small result sets before running broader queries
- For complex or multi-line PR bodies with `gh pr create`, use the `--body-file` flag with a temporary file to avoid escaping issues (e.g., `gh pr create --body-file temp_pr_body.md && rm temp_pr_body.md`).
