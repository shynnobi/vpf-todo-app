- Always use the PR template when creating pull requests
- When using GitHub CLI to create PRs, include the PR template with: `--body "$(cat .github/pull_request_template.md)"`
- PR titles should follow the conventional commit format (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
- Fill out all relevant sections of the PR template with detailed information
- Always reference related tasks or issues in the "Tasks completed" section
- Mark the appropriate checkboxes in the "Type of change" and "Quality assurance" sections
- Never create PRs without using the template structure
