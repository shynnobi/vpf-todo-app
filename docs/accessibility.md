# Accessibility Features

> **Priority**: High
> **Status**: Implemented
> **WCAG Compliance**: Level AA (2.1)

This document outlines the accessibility features implemented in the Todo application to ensure it's usable by people with various disabilities.

## Implemented Features

### Keyboard Navigation

- **Skip Link**: Allows keyboard users to bypass navigation and jump directly to main content (WCAG 2.4.1)
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators on all interactive elements
- **Keyboard Operability**: All functionality is available using keyboard alone (WCAG 2.1.1)
- **Logical Tab Order**: Components receive focus in a logical order that preserves meaning (WCAG 2.4.3)

### ARIA Attributes

- **Landmarks**: Main content area marked with appropriate landmark roles
- **Labels**: All form controls have associated labels (WCAG 1.3.1, 4.1.2)
- **Roles**: Interactive elements have appropriate ARIA roles
- **States**: Interactive elements communicate their states (pressed, checked, expanded)
- **Live Regions**: Dynamic content changes are announced to screen readers

### Screen Reader Support

- **Descriptive Text**: All images and icons have text alternatives
- **Element Relationships**: Parent-child relationships are preserved for nested components
- **Form Validation**: Error messages are announced appropriately
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Tested with screen readers (NVDA/VoiceOver)

### Visual Design

- **Color Contrast**: Text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text)
- **Text Resizing**: Content remains accessible when zoomed up to 200%
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations

## Testing Methodology

We've implemented thorough accessibility testing through:

1. **Automated Testing**: Using axe-core through jest-axe for detecting common accessibility issues
2. **Manual Testing**: Testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers
3. **Component Tests**: Each component has dedicated accessibility tests

## Future Improvements

- Add reduced motion support for users with vestibular disorders
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Add high contrast theme option
- Support RTL languages

## WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria Coverage

- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships**: Information and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined
- **2.1.1 Keyboard**: All functionality is operable through a keyboard interface
- **2.4.1 Bypass Blocks**: A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple pages
- **2.4.3 Focus Order**: Focus order preserves meaning and operability
- **2.4.7 Focus Visible**: Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible
- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value**: For all user interface components, the name and role can be programmatically determined
