# MVP Scope & Prioritization

This document defines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope for the Todo application and prioritizes features for development.

## MVP Definition

The MVP for the Todo application will focus on providing a functional, reliable task management system with core CRUD operations and data persistence. The target is to deliver a simple but complete task management experience that solves the basic user need of keeping track of tasks.

### MVP Features

The following features are included in the MVP scope:

1. **Task Creation** (US-1)

   - Adding new tasks with a title
   - Validation of task input

2. **Task Display** (US-2)

   - List view of all tasks
   - Visual indication of task status
   - Empty state handling

3. **Task Completion** (US-3)

   - Toggling task completion status
   - Visual differentiation of completed tasks

4. **Task Deletion** (US-4)

   - Removing tasks with confirmation
   - Visual feedback on successful deletion

5. **Data Persistence** (US-5)
   - LocalStorage integration
   - Auto-loading of saved tasks
   - Auto-saving on task changes

### Feature Prioritization

| Priority | Feature          | User Story | Implementation Complexity | User Value |
| -------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| 1        | Task Display     | US-2       | Low                       | High       |
| 2        | Task Creation    | US-1       | Low                       | High       |
| 3        | Task Completion  | US-3       | Low                       | High       |
| 4        | Data Persistence | US-5       | Medium                    | High       |
| 5        | Task Deletion    | US-4       | Low                       | Medium     |

## Post-MVP Features

These features are planned for future iterations after the MVP is successfully delivered:

| Priority | Feature          | User Story | Implementation Complexity | User Value |
| -------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| 6        | Task Filtering   | US-6       | Medium                    | Medium     |
| 7        | Task Editing     | US-7       | Medium                    | Medium     |
| 8        | Dark/Light Theme | US-10      | Medium                    | Medium     |
| 9        | Task Priorities  | US-8       | Medium                    | Medium     |
| 10       | Due Dates        | US-9       | High                      | Medium     |

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (MVP)

- Implement task data model and store
- Develop basic UI components
- Implement CRUD operations
- Add data persistence with localStorage

### Phase 2: Enhanced Experience

- Add filtering capabilities
- Implement task editing
- Add theme switching functionality

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- Implement priorities
- Add due dates
- Improve UI/UX with animations and transitions

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful when:

1. Users can reliably create, view, complete, and delete tasks
2. Tasks persist between browser sessions
3. The application works consistently across modern browsers
4. The UI is responsive and works on mobile and desktop devices
5. All automated tests pass with >80% coverage
