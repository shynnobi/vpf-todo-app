# Technical Constraints & Requirements

This document outlines the technical constraints and requirements for the Todo application.

## Technical Stack

The application will be built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library
- **Data Storage**: Browser LocalStorage

## Technical Requirements

### Performance

1. **Initial Load Time**

   - First Contentful Paint < 1.5s on mid-tier devices
   - Time to Interactive < 2s

2. **Runtime Performance**
   - Operations (add, edit, delete tasks) < 100ms response time
   - Smooth 60fps animations and transitions
   - No jank during UI interactions

### Browser Support

- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome for Android)

### Accessibility

1. **Compliance**

   - WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
   - Keyboard navigable (all interactive elements)
   - Screen reader friendly

2. **Design Requirements**
   - Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text
   - Focus states for all interactive elements
   - No reliance on color alone for conveying information

### Responsive Design

- Fluid layout supporting screen widths from 320px to 2560px
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints for:
  - Mobile: 320px - 767px
  - Tablet: 768px - 1023px
  - Desktop: 1024px+

### Security

- Input validation and sanitization
- No sensitive data stored (all data is task-related only)
- XSS prevention in user-entered content

### Code Quality & Maintenance

1. **Testing Requirements**

   - Unit test coverage > 80%
   - Integration tests for critical user flows
   - Component tests for all UI components

2. **Code Standards**
   - Strict TypeScript typing
   - ESLint and Prettier enforcement
   - Functional React components with hooks
   - Component-based architecture

### Data Management

1. **LocalStorage**

   - Graceful handling of storage limits (5-10MB)
   - Fallback mechanism for private browsing mode
   - Version control of stored data schema

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Efficient JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Throttled saving to prevent performance impact
   - Batch operations when possible

## Technical Constraints

### Device Constraints

- Must function on devices with limited memory (1GB RAM)
- Must function on slower CPUs (mobile devices)
- Must handle intermittent network connectivity

### Storage Constraints

- LocalStorage limit (5-10MB depending on browser)
- No reliance on server storage
- Must handle storage permission denials gracefully

### Development Constraints

- Maintain small bundle size (< 200KB gzipped)
- External dependencies must be carefully evaluated
- No backend requirements beyond static file hosting
- Use React best practices (avoid anti-patterns)
